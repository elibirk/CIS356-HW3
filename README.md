Bash scripts. One counts files/directories and modifies permissions. The other gets info from ps aux.

myscript.sh counts the files and directories in /home/ubuntu and then turns on its (HW2c.sh) setuid and setgid bits.

ec.sh count the total processes using ps aux. Then it adds the total VSZ and total RSS.
